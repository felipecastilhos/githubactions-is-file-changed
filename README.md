is-file-changed

This project has been ARCHIVED.

This is just an approach to how triggers an workflow condionaly to a file changing on pull request.
It's outdated and I don't pretend to make it a public action since [path-filter](https://github.com/dorny/paths-filter) action can achieve the same result.
